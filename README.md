# FrontEndArt
Hey there, 

Well I am an explorer and I explored quiet a lot in my freshmen year, 
and this front-end art was made using HTML Canvas and the first time i saw 
all of it I was impressed how simple css and html can make beautiful creations. 

I started learning it and created this particular HTML, CSS effects. 

Well is it anything of much value in my resume?? Lol No, :P

Regardless of that I just found it to be fun and engaging. I did it coz I was happy.
